	<p class="lead">Hello there!<br><br>
	My name is Ashish and I am a magician. In fact, all my peers, or anyone who plays with code, are magicians. 
	<br><br>We make our computers do what we want it to do. We run our fingers through the keyboard, write some awesome code and some very handful compilers understand our needs and based on that it generates some 0s and 1s for the hardware. And voila, our hardware does exactly what we asked for. Sounds like magic? (Nah?)<br><br>
	Well, I am a Computer Science Graduate Student at Arizona State University. I write code. And I am proud nerd.</p>
