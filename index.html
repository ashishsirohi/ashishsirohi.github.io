	<p >Hello there!<br><br>
	My name is <b>Ashish</b> and it would be an understatement to say that I am a nerd.
	<br><br>I belong to a generation who has been the part of the evolution of Computer Science world and have seen it growing like anything. I still remember the time when I came across the Computer machine for the first time, It was in <b>sixth grade</b>. Then, I wasn't aware of the computational power of that hardware box but it was just a machine for me where I could draw funny <b>painting</b> and play some <b>games</b>. But fast forward to now, I am just mesmerised by all the tech growing around and how I love to be the part of this growth.
	<br><br>I love the fact that we can make a hardware do anything(in terms of computation) we want it to do by writitng few lines of awesome <b>code</b>. Some very handful compilers understand our code and generate some set of <b>0s</b> and <b>1s</b> from it for the hardware. And <b>voila</b>, our hardware does exactly what we asked for. Sounds like magic? (Nah?)<br><br>
	Well, I am a <b>Computer Science Graduate Student</b> at <b><a style="color:black; text-decoration:none" href="https://www.asu.edu" target="_blank">Arizona State University</a></b>. I write <b>code</b>.</p>
