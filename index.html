		<p >Hello!!<br><br>
		My name is <b>Ashish</b> and it would be an understatement to say that I am a nerd.
		<br><br>I belong to a generation that has been a part of the evolution of Computer Science and have seen it growing like anything. I still remember the day, when I came across a computer machine for the first time, it was in <b>middle school</b>. And at that time, I wasn't aware of the computational power of that hardware box and never thought that someday I will be using it for building some cool stuff like let it play and win a <b>pacman game</b> for me or <b>recognize hand written integers</b> or ask it to do some mundane tasks like constantly look up a class for me when I am asleep etc.
		<!--<br><br>It's no less than a magic that we can make a piece of hardware along with some handful <b>compiler</b> do all the number crunching and do complex, recursive problems by writing few lines of awesome <b>code</b>. It does sound like magic. (Isn't it?)--><br><br>
		But fast forward to now, here I am, mesmerized by all the tech advancements and how I love to play around and try to build stuff on those advancements.<br><br>
		Well, I am a <b>Computer Science Graduate Student</b> at <b><a style="color:black; text-decoration:none" href="https://www.asu.edu" target="_blank">Arizona State University</a></b>. And I take pride in being a <b>Sun Devil</b>. I write <b><code>code</code></b> for fun as well as to pay my bills.</p>
