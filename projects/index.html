        </br></br>
        <h4>Summary</h4>
        <p>Arizona State University is huge, home to approximately 80K students from around the world. And it offers a large variety of courses across different domains to accommodate all the students but sometimes, few courses are red hot, maybe because of the professor or maybe it's their last chance to get the course as they are graduating or it's a degree requirement course etc. but it's not possible to accommodate all. So the only hope of getting the course is if somebody changes his/her mind and drops it. But ASU doesn't have any system which can notify students if a course has been dropped or something similar. <br><br>In order to grab that open course, you have to be on the course site all the time and check it continuously. Lots of waste of time, right? and even after that, there is no guarantee that will get that course. I myself faced the issue and that's how I came up with the idea of writing a script which will track the status of the specified course and notify me once it is available. I wrote it, it worked and I got the course. But then I thought, why not help other students as everyone is not from Computer Science background or write code. So I turned my script into a fully functional <a target="_blank" href="https://asuca.herokuapp.com">web application</a> where users can sign up/login in and register for the courses they want to get notified for.
        </p>

        <h4>App features/My Work</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>User login/Signup implemented using Django Authentication system</li>
          <li>User can search for the course availability, if not available, they can add that course to their notification list</li>
          <li>User can manage their notification list by adding more courses or deleting existing ones</li>
          <li>A Python script, running periodically using heroku scheduler to check the status of the specified course, shares the same Postgres database as of the Django Web App</li>
          <li>Multithreading is being used to check the status of multiple courses in parallel if course is available, an email is being sent to all the users who have this course on their notification list</li>
          <li>Designed the database efficiently to avoid unnecessary use of resources</li>
          <li>Used PhantomJS web driver(optimized it) along with BeautifulSoup for efficient web page scrapping</li>
        </ul>

        <h4 style="display:inline">Tech Used: </h4>Python, Django with Authentication Systems & Django Forms, PostgreSQL, JavaScript, HTML, Bootstrap, jQuery, PhantomJS, Selenium Package, <code>BeautifulSoup</code>, <code>heroku</code></br>

        </br></br>
        <h4>Summary</h4>
        <p>Today, we all know the importance of connectivity or being online. If we weren't connected now, you were not be reading this. Millions of emails, messages, confidential information are traveling via the network from one node to another on daily basis. Even if this network goes down for few seconds, the world comes to a standstill. And there are many kinds of disasters happening around like Tsunami, Hurricane, Floods etc., may affect the connectivity of networks. Thus, it is important to have a robust network which is immune to such faults. But the big challenge here is, as the network might be over a vast geographical area, it is difficult to test the robustness of the network. In this project, we have build a Web-based tool (based on an approach given in a <a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7470837/" target="_blank">research paper</a> published by <a href="http://www.public.asu.edu/~halla/" target="_blank">Dr. Sen</a> and team) that helps us estimate the impact of such disasters(fault) on a given network.</p>

        <h4>My Contribution</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Designed the high level architecture of the web application</li>
          <li>Intergarated the Google Maps in the front end and made it fully interactive so that user can design a new network, edit existing one, delete/update nodes, edges in the graph etc.</li>
          <li>Desgined the database for the application</li>
          <li>Developed different request handlers(server as well as client side) to and from server</li>
          <li>Used results from different algorithms(developed by other contributors) for testing generic and specified fault for a given network infrastructure</li>
          <li>Integration of differet modules, in and out testing and deployement of the web app on ASU server</li>
        </ul>

  <div style="float: left" ><h3>Extraction, Ranking & Indexing of Multimedia Features</h3></div><br>
                <div style="float: right">[ASU, Fall 2016]</div>
        </br></br>
        <h4>Summary</h4>
        <p>We are living in an era where information/data is increasing substantially on daily basis and we need to organize, store that information so that it can be used later by the users. And when we say word “Information”, it can be of any type like numerical, text based, image, video etc., also it can be further divided into two categories i.e. relevant and irrelevant information. So here we are dealing with two situations i.e. first, how to go about organize and storing this information so that it can be retrieved efficiently later on and second, how to get the perfect and optimized result from the stored information. This project is mainly focused on second part where we have used different feature extraction techniques which we are going to discuss further in detail in different sections. And using these extraction techniques we will try to compute the distance and similarity between the two multimedia objects. And later on using <a target="_blank" href="http://ilpubs.stanford.edu:8090/361/">PageRank Algorithm</a>, we will create a relevancy graph and rank them. Also, we have used some dimension reduction and indexing techniques to make search more efficient</p>

        <h4>My Contribution</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Extracted different multimedia(video) features like histogram, sift vectors, motion vectors using MATLAB</li>
          <li>Performed subsequence search for similar frames on a multimedia database based on different similarity measures like Cosine Similarity, Euclidian distance, Mahalanobis distance etc.</li>
          <li>Generated similarity graph for video frames and found most significant frames using PageRank Algorithm</li>
          <li>Performed dimensionality reduction using PCA & LSH for fast query processing</li>
        </ul>

        <h4 style="display:inline">Tech Used: </h4>Python, MATLAB Scripting, Visual basics</br>

  <div style="float: left" ><h3>Android App for Tempe City Orbit Bus Service</h3></div><br>
                <div style="float: right">[ASU, Fall 2016]</div>
        </br></br>
        <h4>Summary</h4>
        <p>Moving to a new city is itself a cumbersome task, and it becomes more hectic when you don't have a car/bike to commute within the city. We all have been there and most of us will agree to it. The main motivation behind this project idea is to help a new person who has just moved to Tempe(a city in AZ), to adapt to the existing transportation services. <a target="_blank" href="http://www.tempe.gov/city-hall/public-works/transportation/bus/orbit">Orbit</a> is a free-fare bus service that uses small buses to serve around residential areas in Tempe. It's a lifesaver for students, but students being students, running to the classes at the last minute, it would be extremely helpful if they know when and from where they can expect the next bus to their class/campus. Being new to the city, we felt the need of such app that gives information on the buses and their routes to make move in a little easy. So there are two aspects to this project: complete information about the Orbit bus service and real-time tracking of the orbit buses.</p>
        <h4>My Contribution</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Explored Google Maps API & Google Direction API to implement feature like Nearest bus stop, Orbit bus route from source to destination, estimated time to reach, total distance & traffic status</li>
          <li>Used Google Places API for autocompletion of destination field</li>
          <li>Maintianed Search history</li>
          <li>Developed different UIs for users and drivers with login/signup feature
          <li>Maintained a centralized database for bus full & change route status (controlled by driver)</li>
        </ul>

        <h4 style="display:inline">Future Work: </h4>Implementation of the second aspect i.e. real time tracking of the bus, for that Driver's app is ready, will be working on creating a server in middle to handle the location data for live tracking.</br>

        <h4 style="display:inline">Tech Used: </h4>Java, Android Studio, Google Map, Direction & Places API, Firebase Database</br>

  <div style="float: left" ><h3>IP Reflectore</h3></div><br>
                <div style="float: right">[ASU, Feb 2017]</div>
        </br></br>
        <h4>Summary</h4>
        <p>The goal of this project was to create a “reflector” using <code>python-scapy</code> package which will relaunch attacks sent to a given IP address and ethernet address to the IP address that sent the attack. This acted as a mirror, such that when an adversary is portscanning a network, they will actually be port scanning themselves. When they launch an exploit at the reflector, the attack will be reflected back at them.</p>

        <h4>My Contribution</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Developed an IP reflector which detects all kinds of data packets sent to victim and reflects them back to the attacker</li>
          <li>Exploited Python-Scapy package for creating spoofed packets to fool the attacker</li>
        </ul>

        <h4 style="display:inline">Tech Used: </h4>Python, Scapy, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.wireshark.org/">Wireshark</a>, tcpdump</br>

        <h4>Summary</h4>
        <p>As a part of the class CSE545, <a target="_blank" href="http://adamdoupe.com">Prof. Doupé</a> organized the attack-defence type <a target="_blank" href="https://ctftime.org/ctf-wtf/">CTF Comptition</a> in the finals. In order to perform well in the CTF competition,  we decided to build multiple tools to prevent a variety of attacks like Buffer overflow attacks, Path attacks, XSS attacks, SQL injection, and Format string attacks. We also developed scripts to find XSS vulnerabilities in a website, and automate XSS attacks and SQL injections. </p>

        <h4>My Contribution</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Implemented chroot environment for the prevention of path attacks</li>
          <li>Automated Scripts to exploit different vulnerabilities</li>

                <div style="float: right">[ASU, Feb 2017]</div>
        </br></br>
        <h4>Summary</h4>
        <p>A critical part of establishing persistence on a system is to leave a “backdoor” that allows the hacker access to the system at a later date, without exploiting the same vulnerabilities (as they may be fixed in the meantime). In this mini project, I have written a backdoor that pretends to be a web server. The goal of this mini project was to build an HTTP 1.1 server from scratch in C based on <a target="_blank" href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616">RFC 2616</a> with backdoor functionality. The backdoor functionality is that when your server receives a GET request for a URL in the form of <code>/exec/&lt;command&gt;</code>, then your server should take <code>&lt;command&gt;</code> and execute it using the system <code>Linux system call</code> and the HTTP response will be the stdout of the executed command.</p>

        <h4 style="display:inline">Tech Used: </h4>C Socket Programming, Linux System Calls, <code>popen</code></br>

  <div style="float: left" ><h3>QA System for Academic Research Papers and Ranking using MLN</h3></div><br>
                <div style="float: right">[ASU, Spring 2017]</div>
        </br></br>
        <h4>Summary</h4>
        <p>A common way to start learning about new field is to look up the most notable or landmark research papers related to that field and learn from them, but usually, it is very hard to find
        such papers. As more research papers are being published than ever, database is growing at an alarming rate so it is very important to have a system which can produce more accurate user’s query results based on the semantic analysis of the research papers. Also, a user can query about different aspects of a research paper like what is this paper about? or what methods this paper uses? or what are the new findings in this paper? So all these different kind of aspects require semantic analysis and extraction of semantic information from the paper. In this research paper, we are discussing one such system which can help users in finding more accurate results about research papers based on the different aspects user is looking for.</p>

        <h4>My Contribution</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Explored Google's Knowledge Graph for query expansion</li>
          <li>Used DBpedia for creating more meaningful knowledge base</li>
          <li>Designed the MLN (Markov Logic Network) Model for ranking of papers</li>
          <li>Worked on the evaluation of the result</li>

  <div style="float: left" ><h3>Analyzing Geospatial Data and Finding NYC Taxi Hotspots using GeoSpark</h3></div><br>
                <div style="float: right">[ASU, Spring 2017]</div>
        </br></br>
        <h4>Summary</h4>
        <p>We are living in an era where millions of people are going online each day and a huge amount of data is being generated and a major part of the data is location based. It would be interesting to perform certain analysis and operations on the top of it to make some sense out of this huge data as it can benefit us in solving some major social issues as well as it may benefit private organizations. In this project, we have mainly focused on the spatial data to perform certain geospatial operations on the top of it. It is very important to choose an efficient system for doing such operations on a huge data set as geospatial operations are expensive, also we need to make sure that our system is scalable, can perform in-memory computation efficiently, can leverage the benefits of distributed systems. <a target="_blank" href="https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/f0af/b80bad19054c72db579e87b4285b7d2dedab.pdf">GeoSpark</a> being an extension to the Spark for doing efficient in-memory operations on the spatial data will be an interesting choice for doing all spatial operations efficiently. We were also motivated to see how different algorithms can affect the system performance in the different type of spatial operations.</p>
