        <h4>Summary</h4>
        <p>Today, we all know the importance of connectivity or being online. If we weren't connected now, you were not be reading this. Millions of emails, messages, confidential information are travelling via network from one node to another on daily basis. Even if this network goes down for few seconds, world comes to a stand still. And there are many kind of disasters happeing around like Tsunami, Hurricane, Floods etc., may affect the connectivity of networks. Thus, it is important to have a robust network which is immune to such faults. But the big challenge here is, as network might be over a vast geographical area, it is difficult to test the robustness of the network. In this project, we have build a tool (based on a approach given in a <a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7470837/" target="_blank">research paper</a> published by <a href="http://www.public.asu.edu/~halla/" target="_blank">Dr. Sen</a> and team) that helps us estimate the impact of such disasters(fault) on a given network.</p>

        <h4>My Contribution</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Designed the high level architecture of the web application</li>
          <li>Intergarated the Google Maps in the front end and made it fully interactive so that user can design a new network, edit existing one, delete/update nodes, edges in the graph etc.</li>
          <li>Desgined the database for the application</li>
          <li>Developed different request handlers(server as well as client side) to and from server</li>
          <li>Used results from different algorithms(developed by other contributors) for testing generic and specified fault for a given network infrastructure</li>
          <li>Integration of differet modules, in and out testing and deployement of the web app on ASU server</li>
        </ul>

  <div style="float: left" ><h3>Extraction, Ranking & Indexing of Multimedia Features</h3></div><br>
                <div style="float: right">[ASU, Fall 2016]</div>
        </br></br>
        <h4>Summary</h4>
        <p>We are living in an era where information/data is increasing substantially on daily basis and we need to organize, store that information so that it can be used later by the users. And when we say word “Information”, it can be of any type like numerical, text based, image, video etc., also it can be further divided in to two categories i.e. relevant and irrelevant information. So here we are dealing with two situations i.e. first, how to go about organize and storing this information so that it can be retrieved efficiently later on and second, how to get the perfect and optimized result from the stored information. This project is mainly focused on second part where we have used different feature extraction techniques which we are going to discuss further in detail in different sections. And using these extraction techniques we will try to compute the distance and similarity between the two multimedia objects. And later on using <a target="_blank" href="http://ilpubs.stanford.edu:8090/361/">PageRank Algorithm</a>, we will create a relevancy graph and rank them. Also, we have used some dimension reduction and indexing techniqes to make search more efficient</p>

        <h4>My Contribution</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Extracted different multimedia(video) features like histogram, sift vectors, motion vectors using MATLAB</li>
          <li>Performed subsequence search for similar frames on a multimedia database based on different similarity measures like Cosine Similarity, Ecludian distance, Mahalanobis distance etc.</li>
          <li>Generated similarity graph for video frames and found most significant frames using PageRank Algorithm</li>
          <li>Performed dimensionality reduction using PCA & LSH for fast query processing</li>
        </ul>

  <div style="float: left" ><h3>Android App for Tempe City Orbit Bus Service</h3></div><br>
                <div style="float: right">[ASU, Fall 2016]</div>
        </br></br>
        <h4>Summary</h4>
        <p>Moving to a new city is itself a cumbersome task, and it becomes more hectic when you don't have a car/bike to commute within the city. We all have been there and most of us will agree to it. The main motivation behind this project idea is to help a new person who has just moved to Tempe(city in AZ), to adapt to the existing transportation services. <a target="_blank" href="http://www.tempe.gov/city-hall/public-works/transportation/bus/orbit">Orbit</a> is a free-fare bus service that uses small buses to serve around residential areas in Tempe. It's a life saver for students, but students being students, running to the classes at the last minute, it would be a extremly helpful if they know when and from where they can expect the next bus to their class/campus. Being new to the city, we felt the need of such app that gives information on the buses and their routes to make move in a little easy. So there are two aspects to this project: complete information about the Orbit bus service and real time tracking of the orbit buses.</p>
        <h4>My Contribution</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Exploited Google Maps API & Google Direction API to implement feature like Nearest bus stop, Orbit bus route from source to destination, estimated time to reach, total distance & traffic status</li>
          <li>Used Google Places API for autocompletion of destination field</li>
          <li>Mainatianed Search history</li>
          <li>Developed different UIs for users and drivers with login/signup feature
          <li>Maintained a centralized database for bus full & change route status (controlled by driver)</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h4 style="display:inline">Future Work: </h4>Implemetation of second aspect i.e. real time tracking of the bus, for that Driver's app is ready, will be working on creating a server in middle to handle the location data for live tracking.</br>

        <h4 style="display:inline">Tech Used: </h4>Java, Android Studio, Google Map, Direction & Places API, Firebase Database</br>

  <div style="float: left" ><h3>IP Reflectore</h3></div><br>
                <div style="float: right">[ASU, Feb 2017]</div>
        </br></br>
        <h4>Summary</h4>
        <p>The goal of this project was to create a “reflector” using <code>python-scapy</code> package which will relaunch attacks sent to a given IP address and ethernet address to the IP address that sent the attack. This acted as a mirror, such that when an adversary is portscanning a network, they will actually be port scanning themselves. When they launch an exploit at the reflector, the attack will be reflected back at them.</p>

        <h4>My Contribution</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Developed an IP reflector which detects all kinds of data packets sent to victim and reflects them back to the attacker</li>
          <li>Exploited Python-Scapy package for creating spoofed packets to fool the attacker</li>
        </ul>

        <h4 style="display:inline">Tech Used: </h4>Python, Scapy, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.wireshark.org/">Wireshark</a>, tcpdump</br>

                <div style="float: right">[ASU, Spring 2017]</div>
        </br></br>
        <h4>Summary</h4>
        <p>As a part of the class CSE545, <a target="_blank" href="http://adamdoupe.com">Prof. Doupé</a> organised the attack-defence type <a target="_blank" href="https://ctftime.org/ctf-wtf/">CTF Comptetion</a> in the finals. In order to perform well in the competetion,  we decided to build multiple tools to prevent a variety of attacks like Buffer overflow attacks, Path attacks, XSS attacks, SQL injection and Format string attacks. We also developed scripts to find XSS vulnerabilities in a website, and automate XSS attacks and SQL injections. </p>

        <h4>My Contribution</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Implemented chroot environment for the prevention of path attacks</li>
          <li>Automated Scripts to exploit different vulnerabilities</li>
          <li>Worked on patching of different services on the game server</li>
          <li>Successfully patched all the services and ran automated scripts in the test game server</li>
        </ul>
        <h4 style="display:inline">Tech Used: </h4>Python, C, SQL, JavaScript, PHP, HTML, Shell Scripting, <code>objdump</code></br>
